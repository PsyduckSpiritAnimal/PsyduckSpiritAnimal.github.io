        Local Tennis Courts of NYC
    </div>
    
    <p class='paragraph'>Tennis is a simple sport at the recreational level. You and a friend, hitting a ball back and forth over a net with rackets. Yet despite its simplicity or possibly because of it, tennis is incredibly cathartic. All worries become second priority. Nothing else matters. Only a few months ago, I was in Australia. It was a baking hot day and I’d been sitting still inside for hours. This was making me restless. To make matters worse I had also been bored enough to search through Australian cable TV and stumble upon the sports channel. Suddenly reminded of her earlier days of playing tennis as a kid, my mom suggested we head to the local tennis center and have a hit. And while originally I disliked the idea, believing the trip there would be a burden and disliking the thought of standing around in the sun, I still followed her. I didn’t know that this would become the thing I looked forward to the most every single day.
    </p>
    <p class='paragraph'>Alas the trip to Australia ended but my eagerness to continue enjoying the sport did not. The sun was nearly spent, but the jet lag that had plagued me had loosened its grasp. Laughing, we decided to check out the local tennis courts. We walked along Houston street, crossed FDR, passed over puddles and there it was. By the east river, a total of twelve tennis courts stood in front of us. Where Australian courts were smooth and even, these were cracked and slanted. Where Australian courts stood pristine, the New York courts lay littered with a minefield of puddles and muck. 
    </p>
    <p class='paragraph'>We weren’t surprised by any of this. My mom has lived in New York City for 30 years now. The city changes every day. Buildings come and go, but filth is the one true constant. Sidewalks crack, roads crumble, and all things decay. Yet why do people stay? People stay in New York because none of that matters. Not to the dedicated NYers at least. For every crack has a story. With every change to the street corner, the memories remain. We know that the city's a mess. We’ve tripped on sudden bumps in the sidewalk. But this forms a familiar connection. Our decrepit city. Our glorious mess known as NY. 
    </p>
    <p class='paragraph'>These courts are the jewel of my city. It may confuse you why these courts are my favorite part of NY as I’ve said nothing but horrible things about them. Well, despite their grittiness, these courts really are wonderful. They are wonderful because they are where people experience joy. They’ve seen millions come and go yet they remain welcoming. Rows of NewYorkers, drenched with sweat, wide smiles across their faces on a hot summer morning. On a Wednesday evening you’ll find all sorts of people here. You’ll see athletic businessmen who’ve biked straight from the office. You’ll see a dad playing with his three year old daughter. The people here are exactly where they want to be and there is something truly special about that. While as tennis courts they couldn’t get much worse, as a place of common connection between strangers and a haven for shared joy, I believe they are unrivaled. 
    </p>
    <p class='paragraph'>NY as a whole is unrivaled in many senses. Never have I seen a city more proud of its grit and heart. A city united by memories and personal connections is far greater than a city of cold evenly paved streets. Here, you will see that New Yorkers aren’t as sociopathic as we’ve been led to believe, and it only takes as little as looking as far as these local tennis courts to see it.
